# Experiment 1: Entropy Search

## Aims
----
- Improve exploration strategy by testing areas of high information (many relations).

## Update
----
Essentially pointless without implementing Experiment 2. It will select areas of relation but without feedback in the kernel, no improvement/results can be shown. Will revisit after experiment 2.
